## Tasks
1. Movement             (rate?)
2. Balance
3. Sound Responder (?)
4. Distance Detection 
5. Remote Detection (?)

## Interrupts
- Sound
- IR detector

## Boundary Objects

## Communication
- Balance --> Movement
- Sound --> Movement
- Sound Interrupt --> Sound Responder
- IR Interrupt --> Remote Responder
- Distance Detection --> Movement
- Remote Responder --> "Everything" (low power mode even?)

## Obsevations
- Balance and Movement might not always work together -- we need to learn a little bit when we are moving to a target, but that might throw off the balance task.
